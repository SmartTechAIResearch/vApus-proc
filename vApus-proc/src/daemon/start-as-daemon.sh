# This is a start script for running a vapus linux monitor agent as a daemon (service).
# It searches for a file named config, in the directory holding this script, having the agent name at the first line. (Example:vApus-proc)
# It runs that agent using nohup.
# For a correct stdOut put the default port, where the agent will listen at, at the second line of config. (Example:5556)
#
# To stop the service use ./stop-daemon.sh.
#
# Please make sure that you have read and write rights on the directory containing this script. 

# Parse the config file.
